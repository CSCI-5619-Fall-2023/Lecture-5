# Lecture 5: Geometry of Virtual Worlds

The latest commit is the finished code that was pushed at the end of class. If you are intending to implement this program while watching the lecture video, you should checkout the commit labeled `pre-class commit` to get the starter code.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this lecture, you will first need to install:

- [Godot Engine 4.1.1](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You will also need to download the [Polygon Adventure](https://canvas.umn.edu/files/37951294/download?download_frd=1) assets from Canvas and extract them in your project folder.

## Notes

After class, I figured out that the material for the imported models are assigned in .import files. I ran a script to apply the texture to every model in the asset pack and then added the .import files to the repository. This means that you don't have to assign the texture manually for each model (yay!) and will be added to the asset pack files posted on Canvas in the future.
