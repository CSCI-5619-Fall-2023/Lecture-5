# Lecture 5: Geometry of Virtual Worlds

The latest commit is the finished code that was pushed at the end of class. If you are intending to implement this program while watching the lecture video, you should checkout the commit labeled `pre-class commit` to get the starter code.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this lecture, you will first need to install:

- [Godot Engine 4.1.1](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

After checking out the code, you will need to:
1. Download the [Polygon Adventure](https://canvas.umn.edu/files/37951294/download?download_frd=1) assets from Canvas and extract them in your project folder.
2. If you are prompted to install [FBX2glTF](https://godotengine.org/fbx-import/), this means you need to download the FBX importer. You should place the executable file in the same location as the Godot engine, as shown in the video from class.

## Notes

Note: After class, I figured out that the materials for the imported models are assigned in .import files. I ran a script to apply the texture to every model in the asset pack and then added all the .import files to the repository. This means that you don't have to assign the texture manually for each model (yay!). The asset pack files posted on Canvas will be updated in the near future to include the materials.
